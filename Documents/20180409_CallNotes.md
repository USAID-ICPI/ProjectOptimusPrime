USAID/Zambia: Arthur, Erin, Ashley

USAID/W: Aaron, Gina

**Background:**
- A partner that's been performing well was looking at their data to optimize PITC - Ex. maximizing hours in highest yield testing points. 
- Would like to build a tool to do this for our partners
- Highly motivated head clinicians think they're doing best for the program, but have not run their assumptions through the data
- Would like a tool where the clinicians can input different values for staffing allocations and see what happens to the data
- What unit of analysis should be used for staffing LOE?
  - Should it be hours or days? This part is flexible bc it's the multiplier  
  - Maybe % coverage of patients instead of hours - where are you testing everyone and where are you not reaching all patients  
  - Have clinician estimate number of ppl passing through that entry point?  
  - In simplest form, can use qty of employees; this may not work for our purposes bc a single staff member may be covering multiple entry points  
- What if analysis may need an upper and lower bound for staff allocations bc we don't want to completely zero out a modality; 
  - It may be ok to put in a zero bc is the tool is not meant to be absolute, and won't be distributed for implementation; just a way to show clinician how data can be used to optimize  
		
**MER input:**
- Don't need trends; only need one quarter of data only
- Will use FV, not in-process data from the genie
- Total numerator only, no disaggs
	
**Timeline:**
- Won't deploy until have FV for Q2;
- Aaron and Gina to supply tool using Q1 data for feedback and iterative changes to be ready for Q2


**Next Steps for Aaron & Gina**
- [X] Notes in doc folder or wiki (gina)
- [ ] Write code for fv, total numerator only (both)
- [ ] Research what if (both)
- [ ] Think about structure (both)
