Drafts developed and stored internally [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gUNcastcFzmX7OzBYHAPqW3oST09VtO7). Sent draft to team with the below notes:

**Calculations:**
- FY18Q1 testing volume/current # of counselor hours for each modality = # of tests per hour
- Anticipated testing volume = # of tests per hour * anticipated # of counselor hours
- Anticipated # of positives = anticipated testing volume * FY18Q1 yield

**Considerations:**
- Since the model assumes unlimited demand, should we consider revisiting the idea of incorporating % coverage of patients (where are you testing everyone vs where are you not reaching all patients)?
- Impact when current # of pos & current positivity = 0
- Impact of zeroing out counselor hours for a modality when entering anticipated counselor hours

**Aesthetics & Structure:**
- Which table layout is the most intuitive and useful to you?
- Do you need to be able to select a particular partner and then see just those facilities in the drop down list?
- Do you need to be able to print and fit both the table and visual all on one page?
